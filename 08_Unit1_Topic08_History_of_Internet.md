# Unit 1, Topic 8: History of Computer Networking and the Internet

To conclude our first unit, let's take a brief journey through time to understand how the global network we know today came into existence. Understanding its history explains many of its design choices and characteristics.

## Key Historical Phases

### 1. The Dawn of an Idea (1961-1968): Packet Switching
The theoretical foundation of the Internet was laid in the 1960s. The concept of **packet switching**, which we studied earlier, was independently developed by three key figures:
- **Leonard Kleinrock** at MIT (USA)
- **Paul Baran** at the RAND Institute (USA)
- **Donald Davies** at the National Physical Laboratory (UK)
This was a radical departure from the circuit-switched model of the telephone network.

### 2. ARPANET (1969-1980s): The Forerunner
The first large-scale implementation of a packet-switched network was the **ARPANET**, funded by the U.S. Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA).
- **1969:** The first node is installed at UCLA. By the end of the year, four nodes are connected.
- **1972:** The first "killer app," **email**, is demonstrated by Ray Tomlinson. It quickly becomes the most popular application.
- **1974:** **Vint Cerf** and **Robert Kahn** publish their paper on a unified "internetting" protocol, which would later become **TCP/IP**. Their goal was to connect multiple different networks together.

### 3. Proliferation and Standardization (1980s)
The 1980s saw the growth of many other networks besides ARPANET, such as CSNET and NSFNET.
- **1983:** A pivotal year. ARPANET officially adopts the **TCP/IP protocol suite**. This is often considered the "birth" of the modern Internet protocol architecture.
- **1986:** The U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) launches **NSFNET**, providing a high-speed "backbone" to connect university networks. NSFNET quickly becomes the primary backbone for the non-military Internet. The Domain Name System (DNS) is also introduced, replacing the old `hosts.txt` files.

### 4. The Modern Internet Emerges (1990-2000)
- **1990:** ARPANET is decommissioned, its role fully taken over by the NSFNET backbone and other networks.
- **1991:** At the CERN research lab in Switzerland, **Tim Berners-Lee** invents the **World Wide Web**. He develops the core components:
    - **HTML** (HyperText Markup Language)
    - **HTTP** (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
    - The first **Web Browser** and **Web Server**.
- **1993:** The **Mosaic** web browser is released by a team at the University of Illinois. It's the first browser with a graphical user interface that can show images inline with text, making the web accessible and exciting for the general public.
- **1995:** NSFNET is decommissioned, and the Internet backbone is transitioned to **commercial Internet Service Providers (ISPs)**. The web explodes in popularity.

### 5. The Commercial and Social Web (2000s-Present)
This era is characterized by the dot-com boom and bust, followed by the rise of:
- **E-commerce:** Amazon, eBay.
- **Social Media (Web 2.0):** Facebook, YouTube, Twitter.
- **Mobile Internet:** The release of the iPhone in 2007 ushered in the era of ubiquitous mobile access.
- **Cloud Computing:** Massive data centers run by Google, Amazon, and Microsoft become the new core infrastructure of the Internet.

## Exam Focus
- **2-Mark Questions:**
    - Who are the fathers of TCP/IP? (Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn).
    - Who invented the World Wide Web? (Tim Berners-Lee).
    - What was ARPANET?
    - What was the significance of the year 1983 for the Internet? (Adoption of TCP/IP).
- **10-Mark Question:**
    - "Trace the evolution of the Internet from the development of ARPANET to the emergence of the World Wide Web. Highlight the key technologies and individuals responsible for its growth."
        - **Tip:** Structure your answer chronologically. Mention packet switching, ARPANET's creation, the invention of email, the design and adoption of TCP/IP, the role of NSFNET, and finally, Tim Berners-Lee's invention of the WWW, which sparked public adoption.

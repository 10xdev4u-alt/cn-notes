# Unit 1, Topic 8: History of Computer Networking and the Internet

To conclude our first unit, let's take a brief journey through time to understand how the global network we know today came into existence. Understanding its history explains many of its design choices and characteristics.

## 1. Key Historical Phases

### a. The Dawn of an Idea (1961-1968): Packet Switching
The theoretical foundation of the Internet was laid in the 1960s. The concept of **packet switching** was independently developed by Leonard Kleinrock, Paul Baran, and Donald Davies, proposing a more robust and efficient alternative to the circuit-switched model of the telephone network.

### b. ARPANET (1969-1980s): The Forerunner
The first large-scale packet-switched network was the **ARPANET**, funded by the U.S. Department of Defense.
- **1969:** The first node is installed at UCLA.
- **1972:** The first "killer app," **email**, is demonstrated by Ray Tomlinson. The network's first host-to-host protocol, the **Network Control Program (NCP)**, allowed applications like this to be built.
- **1974:** **Vint Cerf** and **Robert Kahn** publish their paper on a unified "internetting" protocol, which would later become **TCP/IP**, designed to connect different types of networks together.

### c. Proliferation and Standardization (1980s)
- **1983:** A pivotal year. ARPANET officially transitions from NCP to the **TCP/IP protocol suite**. This is often considered the "birth" of the modern Internet protocol architecture.
- **1986:** The U.S. National Science Foundation launches **NSFNET**, providing a high-speed "backbone" to connect university supercomputer centers. The **Domain Name System (DNS)** is also introduced, replacing `hosts.txt` files and making the network far more user-friendly.

### d. The Modern Internet Emerges (1990-2000)
- **1990:** ARPANET is decommissioned.
- **1991:** At CERN, **Tim Berners-Lee** invents the **World Wide Web**, developing its core components: **HTML**, **HTTP**, URLs, and the first Web Browser and Server. This transformed the Internet from a tool for specialists into a medium for everyone.
- **1993:** The **Mosaic** graphical web browser is released, sparking an explosion in public interest.
- **1995:** The NSFNET backbone is retired, and the Internet is fully transitioned to **commercial Internet Service Providers (ISPs)**.

### e. The Commercial and Social Web (2000s-Present)
This era is characterized by the dot-com boom and bust, followed by the rise of:
- **E-commerce** (Amazon, eBay)
- **Social Media & User-Generated Content (Web 2.0)** (Facebook, YouTube)
- **Mobile Internet** (smartphones)
- **Cloud Computing** (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)

## 2. Evolutionary Trends

- **Purpose:** From a military/government project (ARPANET) -> an academic and research network (NSFNET) -> a global commercial and social platform.
- **Technology:** From a single network (ARPANET) -> a network of networks united by TCP/IP.
- **Access:** From a tool for a few hundred specialists -> a utility for billions of people, increasingly via mobile devices.

## Exam Focus
- **2-Mark Questions:**
    - Who are the fathers of TCP/IP? (Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn).
    - Who invented the World Wide Web? (Tim Berners-Lee).
    - What was the significance of the year 1983 for the Internet? (Official adoption of TCP/IP by ARPANET).
- **10-Mark Question:**
    - "Trace the evolution of the Internet from the development of ARPANET to the emergence of the World Wide Web. Highlight the key technologies and individuals responsible for its growth."
        - **Tip:** Structure your answer chronologically. Mention packet switching, ARPANET's creation (and its first protocol, NCP), the invention of email, the design and adoption of TCP/IP, the role of NSFNET and DNS, and finally, Tim Berners-Lee's invention of the WWW, which sparked public adoption.
